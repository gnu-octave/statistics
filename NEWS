 Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.8.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Important Notice: 1) Minimum Octave version required is 9.1.0
                   2) Add dependency to the datatypes package
                   3) Incompatibility with the `nan` package
                   4) Updated 'libsvm' library to version 3.36
                   5) Using `tablicious` as a drop in replacement
                      for `datatypes` might cause issues.  Future
                      development of statistical functions to enable
                      support for tables and categorical arrays will
                      be based on the implementations in `datatypes`
