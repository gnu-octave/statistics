 Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.8.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Important Notice: 1) Minimum Octave version required is 9.1.0
                   2) Add dependency to the datatypes package
                   3) Incompatibility with the `nan` package
                   4) Updated 'libsvm' library to version 3.36
                   5) Using `tablicious` as a drop in replacement
                      for `datatypes` might cause issues.  Future
                      development of statistical functions to enable
                      support for tables and categorical arrays will
                      be based on the implementations in `datatypes`

 New functions:
 ==============

 ** makima

 Improvements:
 =============

 ** fillmissing: added support for the "makima" interpolation method

 ** svmpredict: added support for one class posterior probablity

 Removed functions: (available in core Octave)
 ==================

 ** mad

 ** mean

 ** median

 ** std

 ** var


  Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.8.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Important Notice: 1) Soon after Octave 11.1 is officially released the
                      'statistics' package will update its dependency to
                      Octave 11, so that further development can rely on
                      advancements to core statistics and data functions
                      that will be available with Octave 11.
                   2) Incompatibility with the `nan` package
                   3) Using `tablicious` as a drop in replacement
                      for `datatypes` might cause issues.

 New functions:
 ==============

 ** dummyvar

 Improvements:
 =============

 ** cvpartition: 'summary' method has been implemented

 ** datasample: improved input validation

 ** friedman: returns ANOVA results in a table

 ** grp2idx: fixed MATLAB compatibility, add support for new data types

 ** grpstats: add support for tables and categorical arrays, add ploting
              functionality, fix remaining MATLAB compatiblity issue

 ** hnswSearcher: improved performance in building index and query operations

 ** ismissing: fixed MATLAB compatibility, char arrays do not have standard
               missing values

 ** rmmissing: fixed MATLAB compatibility, char arrays do not have standard
               missing values

 ** standardizeMissing: fixed MATLAB compatibility, char arrays do not have
                        standard missing values

 ** stepwisefit: fixed MATLAB compatibility, replaced legacy Draper-Smith
                 algorithm, results may differ from previous implementation

 ** tabulate: add support for tables and categorical arrays

 ** wishrnd: allow for non-integral DF under certain constrains
