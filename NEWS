 ** Other functions that have been changed for smaller bugfixes, increased
    Matlab compatibility, or performance:

      dcov: returned dcov instead of dcor. added demo.
      violin: can be used with subplots. violin quality improved.
      princomp: Fix expected values of tsquare in unit tests
      fitgmdist: test number inputs to function
      hist3: fix removal of rows with NaN values

 ** added the packages test data to install

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.2.4:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Made princomp work with nargout < 2.

 ** Renamed dendogram to dendrogram.

 ** Added isempty check to kmeans.

 ** Transposed output of hist3.

 ** Converted calculation in hmmviterbi to log space.
 
 ** Bug fixes for
    stepwisefit   wishrnd.

 ** Rewrite of cmdscale for improved compatibility.

 ** Fix in squareform for improved compatibility.

 ** New cvpartition class, with methods:
  
    display repartition test training

 ** New sample data file fisheriris.txt for tests

 ** The following functions are new:
 
    cdf crossval dcov pdist2 qrandn randsample signtest ttest ttest2
    vartest vartest2 ztest


Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.2.3:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Made sure that output of nanstd is real.

 ** Fixed second output of nanmax and nanmin.

 ** Corrected handle for outliers in boxplot.

 ** Bug fix and enhanced functionality for mvnrnd.
 
 ** The following functions are new:
 
    wishrnd iwishrnd wishpdf iwishpdf cmdscale

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.2.2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Fixed documentation of dendogram and hist3 to work with TexInfo 5.

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.2.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new:

      pcares  pcacov  runstest  stepwisefit hist3

 ** dendogram now returns the leaf node numbers and order that the nodes were displayed in.

 ** New faster implementation of princomp.

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.2.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new:

      regress_gp  dendogram   plsregress

 ** New functions for the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution:
      
      gevcdf gevfit gevfit_lmom gevinv gevlike gevpdf gevrnd gevstat
      
 ** The interface of the following functions has been modified:

      mvnrnd

 ** `kmeans' has been fixed to deal with clusters that contain only
    one element.

 ** `normplot' has been fixed to avoid use of functions that have been
    removed from Octave core. Also, the plot produced should now display some
    aesthetic elements and appropriate legends.

 ** The help text of `mvtrnd' has been improved.

 ** Package is no longer autoloaded.

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.1.3:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in 1.1.3:

      copularnd mvtrnd

 ** The functions mnpdf and mnrnd are now also usable for greater numbers
    of categories for which the rows do not exactly sum to 1.

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.1.2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in 1.1.2:

      mnpdf mnrnd

 ** The package is now dependent on the io package (version 1.0.18 or
    later) since the functions that it depended of from miscellaneous
    package have been moved to io.

 ** The function `kmeans' now accepts the 'emptyaction' property with
    the 'singleton' value. This allows for the kmeans algorithm to handle
    empty cluster better. It also throws an error if the user does not
    request an empty cluster handling, and there is an empty cluster.
    Plus, the returned items are now a closer match to Matlab.

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.1.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in 1.1.1:

      monotone_smooth kmeans jackknife

 ** Bug fixes on the functions:

      normalise_distribution  combnk
      repanova

 ** The following functions were removed since equivalents are now
    part of GNU octave core:

      zscore

 ** boxplot.m now returns a structure with handles to the plot elemenets.

Summary of important user-visible changes for statistics 1.1.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** IMPORTANT note about `fstat' shadowing core library function:

    GNU octave's 3.2 release added a new function `fstat' to return
    information of a file. Statistics' `fstat' computes F mean and
    variance. Since MatLab's `fstat' is the equivalent to statistics'
    `fstat' (not to core's `fstat'), and to avoid problems with the
    statistics package, `fstat' has been deprecated in octave 3.4
    and will be removed in Octave 3.8. In the mean time, please
    ignore this warning when installing the package.

 ** The following functions are new in 1.1.0:

      normalise_distribution  repanova  combnk

 ** The following functions were removed since equivalents are now
    part of GNU octave core:

      prctile

 ** The __tbl_delim__ function is now private.

 ** The function `boxplot' now accepts named arguments.

 ** Bug fixes on the functions:

      harmmean  nanmax  nanmin  regress

 ** Small improvements on help text.
