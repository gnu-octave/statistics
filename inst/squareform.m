## Interchange between distance matrix and distance vector formats.
##
## Converts between a hollow (diagonal filled with zeros), square, and
## symmetric matrix and a vector of the lower triangular part.
##
## Its target application is the conversion of the vector returned by
## @code{pdist} into a distance matrix.  It performs the opposite operation
## if input is a matrix.
##
## If @var{x} is a vector, its number of elements must fit into the
## triangular part of a matrix (main diagonal excluded).  In other words,
## @code{numel (@var{x}) = @var{n} * (@var{n} - 1) / 2} for some integer
## @var{n}.  The resulting matrix will be @var{n} by @var{n}.
##
## If @var{x} is a distance matrix, it must be square and the diagonal entries
## of @var{x} must all be zeros.  @code{squareform} will generate a warning if
## @var{x} is not symmetric.
##
## The second argument is used to specify the output type in case there
## is a single element.  It will default to @qcode{"tomatrix"} otherwise.
