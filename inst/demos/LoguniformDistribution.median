%! ## Compute the median for different Log-uniform distributions
%! pd1 = LoguniformDistribution (1, 5);
%! pd2 = LoguniformDistribution (1, 10);
%! median1 = median (pd1)
%! median2 = median (pd2)
%! 
%! ## Use this to find the median value, which is the geometric mean of
%! ## the bounds, splitting the distribution into equal probability halves.
