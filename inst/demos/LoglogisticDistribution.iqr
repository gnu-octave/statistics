%! ## Compute the interquartile range for a Log-logistic distribution
%! data = loglrnd (0, 1, 10000, 1);
%! pd = fitdist (data, "Loglogistic");
%! iqr_value = iqr (pd)
%!
%! ## Use this to calculate the interquartile range, which measures the spread
%! ## of the middle 50% of the distribution, helpful for understanding central
%! ## variability in positive skewed data like lifetimes.
