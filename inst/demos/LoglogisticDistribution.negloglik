%! ## Compute the negative loglikelihood for a fitted Log-logistic distribution
%! rand ("seed", 21);
%! data = loglrnd (0, 1, 100, 1);
%! pd_fitted = fitdist (data, "Loglogistic");
%! nlogL = negloglik (pd_fitted)

%! ## This is useful for assessing the fit of a Log-logistic distribution to
%! ## data, with lower values indicating a better fit, often used in model
%! ## selection or optimization.
