%! ## Compute the median for different Triangular distributions
%! pd1 = TriangularDistribution (0, 1, 2);
%! pd2 = TriangularDistribution (1, 2, 3);
%! median1 = median (pd1)
%! median2 = median (pd2)
%!
%! ## Use this to find the median value, which splits the distribution into two
%! ## equal probability halves, robust for skewed triangular data in applications
%! ## like scheduling.
