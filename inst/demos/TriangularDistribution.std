%! ## Compute the standard deviation for a Triangular distribution
%! pd = TriangularDistribution (0, 1, 2);
%! std_value = std (pd)
%!
%! ## Use this to calculate the standard deviation, which measures the variability
%! ## within the bounds of the Triangular distribution, useful for risk assessment.
