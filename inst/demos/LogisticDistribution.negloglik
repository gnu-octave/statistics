%! ## Compute the negative loglikelihood for a fitted Logistic distribution
%! pd = makedist ("Logistic", "mu", 0, "sigma", 1)
%! rand ("seed", 21);
%! data = random (pd, 100, 1);
%! pd_fitted = fitdist (data, "LogisticDistribution")
%! nlogL = negloglik (pd_fitted)
%!
%! ## This is useful for assessing the fit of a Logistic distribution to data,
%! ## lower values indicate a better fit, often used in model evaluation.
